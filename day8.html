<!-- when a style attribute is placed inside any html tag then the CSS is called Inline CSS -->

 <!-- when a style TAG is placed inside the head section in out html doc, then this type of CSS is called Internal CSS -->

<!-- when we link our CSS stylesheet in our html doc through the link attribute then this type of css is called External CSS -->

 <!-- external css is the best best css of allbecause of its accessibility secondly it improves readability and understanding of code and it avoid cluttered code and stressful changes in bigger projects -->

  <!-- internal css is not considered best because it enhances the length of the html document by a strong number so the code becomes cluttered as well difficult to modify -->

   <!-- inline css gives you a lot of stress when changing individual elements in a bigger project -->

   <!-- we have selectors and declarations in CSS to help us style our html doc -->
